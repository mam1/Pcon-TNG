 * @brief Control up to 14 servos in other cog.  For up to 28, add the 
 * servoAux library to your project.  Control the first 14 with servo_set,
 * servo_speed, servo_angle, and other servo_ function calls.  Control servos
 * 15 and up with the same function calls, but starting with servoAux_ instead
 * of servo_.  
 * @n @n Currently supports LMM and CMM memory models.  
 * @n    servo library launches a single cog for controlling 1st to 14th servos
 * @n    servoAux library launches an additional cog for controlling the 15th through
 *       28th servos
 *
 * @details This library automatically delivers 
 * control pulses to the servos every 20 ms, all you have to do is use the set 
 * method to pick the pin the servo is connected to and the duration of the 
 * control pulses.
 *
 * Parallax standard servos have a position range from approximately 0 to 180
 * degrees.  
 *
 * @n Please submit bug reports, suggestions, and improvements to
 * this code to editor@parallax.com.

 * @brief Set Parallax Standard Servo to angle from 0 to 180 in tenths of
 * a degree.
 *
 * @details Examples:
 *
 * @code
 * servo_angle(pin, 0);     // for 0 degrees
 * servo_angle(pin, 900);   // for 90 degrees
 * servo_angle(pin, 1800);  // for 180 degrees
 * @endcode
 *
 * 0 to 1800 corresponds to control pulses ranging from 500 to 2300 with 1400
 * at center (90 degrees), which is slightly different from the 1500 center
 * convention, but it places the Parallax Standard Servo's range of motion neatly 
 * between its mechanical limits.
 *
 * @param pin Number of the I/O pin connected to servo
 * @param degreeTenths Tenths of a degree from 0 to 1800
 *
 * @returns pin number = success, -1 = no cogs available, -2 = no locks available, -3 = 
 * all 14 servo slots already filled.

/**
 * @brief Set Parallax Continuous Rotation servo speed.
 *
 * @details Examples:
 *
 * @code
 * servo_speed(pin, 200);    // Twice full speed counterclockwise
 * servo_speed(pin, 100);    // Full speed counterclockwise
 * servo_speed(pin, 0);      // Stay still
 * servo_speed(pin, -100);   // Full speed clockwise
 * servo_speed(pin, -200);   // Twice full speed clockwise
 * @endcode
 *
 * 100 to -100 corresponds to the linear speed control range.  For example,
 * servo_speed(pin, 75) will set the speed to roughly 75% of full speed
 * counterclockwise.  This is a very rough approximation.
 *
 * @param pin Number of the I/O pin connected to servo
 * @param speed Speed from -100 to 100

 * @brief Set the maximum change in control signal a servo will change

 * servo ramp up to and down from whatever speed or position it was previously set to.  
 * It also allows you to set the rate at which a Parallax Standard servo turns
 * from its previous position to a new position.
 *
 * @param pin Number of the I/O pin the servo is connected to
 * @param stepSize The number of microseconds per 20 ms of time that the servo's
 * control signal is allowed to change.  This equates to the number of tenths of
 * a degree a Parallax Standard servo is allowed to change, or the number of
 * 100ths of full speed the a Parallax Continuous Rotation servo is allowed to
 * change per 20 ms.

/**
 * @brief Sets servo control signal to servo connected to a given pin for 
 * microsecond pulse durations.
 *
 * @details This function directly controls the number of microseconds servo
 * control pulses last.
 *
 * Examples for Parallax Standard Servo:
 *
 * @code
 * servo_set(pin, 500);    //   0 degrees
 * servo_set(pin, 1400);   //  90 degrees
 * servo_set(pin, 2300);   // 180 degrees
 * @endcode
 *
 * 500, 1400, and 2300 are the number of microseconds (us) the control pulses
 * stay high.  More generally, a microsecond above 500 corresponds to 1/10
 * of a degree counterclockwise of 0 degrees.  So, for a given degree position, use:
 *
 *   degree position = 500 + (number of 10ths of a degree)
 *
 * For setting Parallax Continuous Rotation Servo speed, use:
 *
 * @li Full speed clockwise        -> servo_set(pin, 1400);
 * @li Stay still                  -> servo_set(pin, 1500);
 * @li Full speed counterclockwise -> servo_set(pin, 1600);
 *
 * Values in the 1400 to 1600 range are (roughly) proportional to speed for a 
 * Parallax Continuous Rotation Servo, but it's not nearly as precise as position 
 * control.  Setting full speeds at 1300 and 1700 is a common practice to make sure 
 * both servos are going as fast as they possibly can.
 *
 * @param pin Number of the I/O pin that sends signals to the servo.
 *
 * @param time Microsecond servo pulse time.
 *
 * @returns pin number = success, -1 = no cogs available, -2 = no locks available, -3 = 
 * all 14 servo slots already filled.
